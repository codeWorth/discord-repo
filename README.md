# discord-repo

A web app and discord bot that lists Discord servers and gives them tags.

Users add their server to the list by inviting my bot to their server. They can then configure the tags for their server by messaging the bot.
Other users can view the website to see discord servers they might like to join.

Tags will be auto corrected if the bot is aware of a correction. For example, "video gaming" might be corrected to "video games" to prevent multiple tags
that mean essentially the same thing.

The website has a tag search feature which, when you begin typing a tag, will offer suggestions for tags that exist, along with how many servers have that tag.
It's very similar to stackoverflow's tag search when you ask a question.
